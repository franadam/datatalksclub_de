# üöÄ **Orchestration ‚Äì Kestra**

### *DataTalksClub - Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2025*

> **Automating and Managing Data Pipelines with Kestra and AWS Athena**  

This readme contains my notes and key takeaways from **Module 2 ‚Äì Workflow Orchestration** of the **DataTalksClub Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2025**. In this module, I explored **Kestra**, focusing on orchestrating workflows for AWS Athena while leveraging Iceberg and External tables.

---

## **üìå What is Workflow Orchestration?**
Workflow orchestration automates data workflows, ensuring tasks **execute in the correct sequence** while handling dependencies and failures. In this module, we used **Kestra**, a **cloud-native orchestrator**, to manage AWS Athena queries.

### **Why Use Kestra?**
‚úÖ **Declarative YAML-Based Workflows** ‚Äì Define workflows using a **code-first approach**  
‚úÖ **Built-in AWS Integrations** ‚Äì Supports S3, Athena, Glue, Lambda, and more  
‚úÖ **Event-Driven Triggers** ‚Äì Automate workflows with **scheduled or event-based** triggers  
‚úÖ **Scalable & Cloud-Native** ‚Äì Designed for distributed and fault-tolerant execution  


# **üìå AWS Athena & Table Types**
AWS Athena is a **serverless query service** that allows analyzing structured and semi-structured data stored in **Amazon S3** using **SQL (Presto/Trino engine).**  

Athena supports multiple table types, including **Iceberg tables** and **External tables**, each with distinct use cases.


## **üßä What is an Iceberg Table?**
**Apache Iceberg** is an open-source table format designed for large-scale analytics. Iceberg tables in Athena provide **ACID transactions**, **time travel**, and **schema evolution**, making them suitable for data warehouses.

### **üîç Features of Iceberg Tables**
‚úî **ACID Transactions** ‚Äì Supports **INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE** operations  
‚úî **Schema Evolution** ‚Äì Allows adding or modifying columns **without rewriting data**  
‚úî **Time Travel** ‚Äì Query historical snapshots of data  
‚úî **Partition Evolution** ‚Äì Update partitioning strategy without reloading data  

### **üõ†Ô∏è Creating an Iceberg Table in AWS Athena**
```sql

  tpep_pickup_datetime timestamp  COMMENT 'The date and time when the meter was engaged',
  tpep_dropoff_datetime timestamp COMMENT 'The date and time when the meter was disengaged',

TBLPROPERTIES (

  'write_compression'='snappy'
);
```



## **üìÅ What is an External Table?**
An **External Table** in AWS Athena is a **logical table definition** that references **raw data stored in S3**. Unlike Iceberg tables, **external tables do not manage metadata changes** (e.g., schema evolution).

### **üîç Features of External Tables**
‚úî **Read-Only Structure** ‚Äì Cannot perform **INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE**  
‚úî **Schema-on-Read** ‚Äì Data remains in **S3 as raw files** (e.g., **CSV, Parquet, ORC**)  
‚úî **Cost-Effective** ‚Äì **No storage costs** in Athena (only pay for query scans)  

### **üõ†Ô∏è Creating an External Table in AWS Athena**
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {{ render(vars.table) }}_ext (
  VendorID string                 COMMENT 'A code indicating the LPEP provider that provided the record. 1= Creative Mobile Technologies, LLC; 2= VeriFone Inc.',

## **üÜö When to Use Iceberg vs. External Tables?**
| Feature           | Iceberg Table | External Table |
|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **ACID Transactions** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Schema Evolution** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Time Travel** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Insert/Update/Delete** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Storage Cost** | **Higher** (manages metadata) | **Lower** (only raw files in S3) |
| **Best Use Case** | **Data Warehousing, Slowly Changing Data** | **Raw Data Exploration, Temporary Analysis** |

### **üìå Summary**
- **Use Iceberg Tables** if you need **mutability (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)** and **schema evolution**.  
- **Use External Tables** when working with **static datasets in S3** where **schema does not change**.

## **üìã Best Practices for AWS Athena & Kestra**
‚úÖ **Use Parquet/ORC over CSV** ‚Äì Columnar formats reduce query costs  
‚úÖ **Partition Data Smartly** ‚Äì Avoid excessive small partitions for performance  
‚úÖ **Use Iceberg for Large-Scale Data Warehouses** ‚Äì Enables better **data management and querying**  
‚úÖ **Limit SELECT \*** ‚Äì Always select specific columns to **reduce scanned data**  
‚úÖ **Monitor Query Costs** ‚Äì Use `EXPLAIN` before running expensive queries  
‚úÖ **Leverage Kestra for Automation** ‚Äì Use **triggers** to automate table refresh and ingestion  

## **üìå Key Takeaways**
üîπ **Athena Iceberg Tables** allow **ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel**  
üîπ **External Tables** are read-only and reference **raw data stored in S3**
